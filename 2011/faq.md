I'm generating a manual table of contents, because Maruku won't generate
one automatically unless the headers cascade from H1 down, and I don't
want a big H1 header in here.

#### How well do I have to know Scala to participate? {#know_scala}

Scala developers of all abilities can contribute in some way. If you've
written a couple hundred lines, you're golden.

#### Do I need to register my project to participate? {#do_i_need_to_register}

No! You are free to work on whatever project you want at the event, or to
recruit others to your project without registering it. Registering a
project brings one obligation and one perk:

* Registered projects have a representative give a 20-minute talk on
  Saturday aimed at helping newcomers develop the project.
* Registered projects are listed on the Scalathon
  [projects page](projects.html).

#### How can I register my project? {#how_to_register}

To register a *project* send us an [email][] with with your name, project
name, and project URL. *Humans* still need to register using meetup.com.

#### Can I give a talk? {#give_a_talk}

Some of the talks are invited, but we strongly encourage others to [email][] us
their proposals. Talks at Scalathon should relate to Scalathon's goal, as
given on the [home page](index.html).

#### How can I volunteer to host an out of town guest? {#host_guest}

Please [email][] us with the following information:

* Your name
* How many guests you would like to accommodate
* Which nights you can accommodate (just Saturday night, or both Friday and Saturday?)
* How you would like prospective guests to contact you (phone number or email address)

#### Who's responsible for this thing? {#culprits}

The Scalathon is [Yuvi Masory][]'s [brainstorm](http://blog.yuvimasory.com/2011/04/scalathon-how-you-can-help.html). Folks from the
[Philly Area Scala Enthusiasts][PHASE] ([PHASE][]) are lending their expertise
and assistance, and [PHASE][] is officially handling registrations.

#### What's with all the company logos? {#logos}

We are very lucky: Many companies are sponsoring Scalathon with financial
donations.

The company logos at the top of each page represent our Big Fish Sponsors,
companies that have donated $1,500 or more to Scalathon.

The company logos at the bottom of each page represent our Little Fish
Sponsors, companies that have donated at least $250 to Scalathon.

Thanks to *all* our sponsors!

#### Who made the logo? {#logo_by_felice}

So glad you asked! The logo was hand drawn by [Felice Ford][].
