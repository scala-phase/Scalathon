# Next year?

**Scalathon 2011 succeeded beyond our expectations!**

**If there's sufficient interest, we fully intend to hold another Scalathon,
in 2012. Stay tuned!**

# Goal

To get Scala developers contributing to the language, its tools, and its
libraries.

# When & Where

* Scalathon was held **July 16-17, 2011** at the
  **[University of Pennsylvania](http://www.upenn.edu)** in
  **[Philadelphia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philadelphia)**.
* For those arriving Friday night July 15, we had a functional programming
  [quizzo](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quizzo) & dinner with
  [Philly Lambda](http://phillylambda.org/) at [Smokey Joe's](http://smokeyjoes.companygoods.com/applications/smokeyjoes/store/).
* Friday also boasted a special meeting of Penn's Programming Languages Club, followed by a documentation spree.

**All Friday events are optional and separate from the main hackathon. It's fine if you can't make it.**
