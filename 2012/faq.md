## How well do I have to know Scala to participate?

Scala developers of all abilities can contribute in some way. If you've
written a couple hundred lines, you're golden.

## Do I need to register my project to participate?

No! You are free to work on whatever project you want at the event, or to
recruit others to your project without registering it. Registering a
project brings one obligation and one perk:

* Registered projects have a representative give a 20-minute talk on
  Saturday aimed at helping newcomers develop the project.
* Registered projects are listed on the Scalathon
  [projects page](projects.html).

## How can I register my project?

To register a *project* send us an [email][] with with your name, project
name, and project URL. *Humans* still need to register using
[meetup.com](http://www.meetup.com/scala-phase/events/57847602/).

## Can I give a talk?

Some of the talks are invited, but we strongly encourage others to [email][] us
their proposals. Talks at Scalathon should relate to Scalathon's goal, as
given on the [home page](index.html).

## How can I volunteer to host an out of town guest?

Please [email][] us with the following information:

* Your name
* How many guests you would like to accommodate
* Which nights you can accommodate (just Saturday night, or both Friday and Saturday?)
* How you would like prospective guests to contact you (phone number or email address)

## Who's responsible for this thing?

Scalathon was originally [Yuvi Masory][]'s [brainstorm](http://blog.yuvimasory.com/2011/04/scalathon-how-you-can-help.html).
It's is a product of the [Philly Area Scala Enthusiasts][PHASE]
([PHASE][]), the Scala user group in Philadelphia. Yuvi and [Brian Clapper][]
are the primary organizers.

## What's this "Big Fish", "Little Fish" stuff?

We are very lucky: Many companies are sponsoring Scalathon with financial
donations.

* Our _Big Fish_ sponsors have donated $1,500 or more to Scalathon.
* Our _Little Fish_ sponsors have donated at least $250 to Scalathon.

Thanks to *all* our sponsors!

## Who made the logo?

Brian Clapper. (Blame him.)
