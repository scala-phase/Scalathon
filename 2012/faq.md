## How well do I have to know Scala to participate?

Scala developers of all abilities can contribute in some way. If you've
written a couple hundred lines, you're golden.

## Do I need to register my project to participate?

No! You are free to work on whatever project you want at the event, or to
recruit others to your project without registering it. Registering a
project brings one obligation and one perk:

* Registered projects have a representative give a 20-minute talk on
  Saturday aimed at helping newcomers develop the project.
* Registered projects are listed on the Scalathon
  [projects page](projects.html).

## How can I register my project?

To register a *project* send us an [email][] with with your name, project
name, and project URL. *Humans* still need to register using
[meetup.com](http://www.meetup.com/scala-phase/events/57847602/).

## Can I give a talk?

Some of the talks are invited, but we strongly encourage others to [email][] us
their proposals. Talks at Scalathon should relate to Scalathon's goal, as
given on the [home page](index.html).

## How can I volunteer to host an out of town guest?

Please [email][] us with the following information:

* Your name
* How many guests you would like to accommodate
* Which nights you can accommodate (just Saturday night, or both Friday and Saturday?)
* How you would like prospective guests to contact you (phone number or email address)

## Who's responsible for this thing?

Scalathon was originally [Yuvi Masory][]'s [brainstorm](http://blog.yuvimasory.com/2011/04/scalathon-how-you-can-help.html).
It's is a product of the [Philly Area Scala Enthusiasts][PHASE]
([PHASE][]), the Scala user group in Philadelphia. Yuvi and [Brian Clapper][]
are the primary organizers.

## What are the various sponsorship levels?

We are very lucky: Many companies are sponsoring Scalathon with financial
donations.

* Gold sponsors have donated $2,000 or more.
* Silver sponsors have donated between $1,000 and $1,999.
* Bronze sponsors have donated between $250 and $999.

Thanks to *all* our sponsors!

## Why don't I see the sponsors?

The most likely culprit is [AdBlock](http://adblockplus.org/en/). Either
disable your AdBlock extension, or add an exception rule for _scalathon.org_:

## Why is there an empty box on the left of this web page?

See the previous question.

## What technologies did you use for the web site?

*scalathon.org* is hosted on [GitHub Pages][], so it's using [Jekyll][],
because that's what drives GitHub Pages. In addition, we use:

* [Sass][], for enhanced CSS goodness.
* [Bourbon][], for enhanced Sass goodness.
* [Twitter Bootstrap][], with the responsive add-ons, to try to make the
  site a little friendlier for mobile devices, as well as regular computers.
* [Sass-Twitter-Bootstrap][], so we can use all the Twitter Bootstrap CSS
  customizations directly from Sass.
* [Rake][], to tie all those technologies together.

## Who made the logo?
