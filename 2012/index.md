# Registration is Open!

[Register now][meetup-page]!

# Talks

We are _actively_ soliciting projects and talks! Please send your proposals
to [contact@scalathon.org](mailto:contact@scalathon.org).

# Goal

To get Scala developers contributing to the language, its tools, and its
libraries.

# When & Where

Scalathon 2012 will held **Saturday, July 28, and Sunday, July 29, 2012**
<span markdown="1"><strike>at the Valley Forge Casino Resort in suburban Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.</strike></span>

<div class="alert alert-error" markdown="1">
**VENUE CHANGE ALERT!** The Valley Forge Casino Resort wanted _way_ too much
money, money we would prefer to spend on food, T-shirts, beer, and other
amenities. So, we're in the process of arranging a new venue. In all
likelihood, **the new location will be in [Philadelphia][]**. In addition to
being less expensive, a venue in the city will be more convenient for out-of-
town visitors.

Stay tuned! We'll have more information soon!
</div>

In addition, on **Friday, July 27**, we will host a special event called
["Anatomy of a Scala Project"][friday-meetup]. See the 
[Event Outline](/2012/outline.html) page for details on the Friday event.

# Details on Registration

Registration is $50 and covers Saturday and Sunday. Space is limited to 150
attendees. Please register on the [Scalathon 2012 Meetup page][meetup-page].

Friday's event, "Anatomy of a Scala Project" has a separate registration fee
and a separate [Meetup page][friday-meetup], since it might not appeal to every
Scalathon attendee. The cost to attend Friday's "Anatomy of a Scala Project"
event is $25 per participant.
