# Registration is Open!

[Register now][meetup-page]!

# Goal

To get Scala developers contributing to the language, its tools, and its
libraries.

# Talks

We are _actively_ soliciting projects and talks! Please send your proposals
to [contact@scalathon.org](mailto:contact@scalathon.org).


# When & Where

Scalathon 2012 will held **Saturday, July 28, and Sunday, July 29, 2012** in
The [Quorum][], at the [University City Science Center][], in [Philadelphia][],
Pennsylvania. The Quorum is a beautiful space, and good network connectivity is
assured. The Quorum is only a few blocks from where we held last year's
Scalathon, so you'll have access to the samegood restaurants, parking
facilities and other amenities associated with Philadelphia's University City.

In addition, on **Friday, July 27**, we will host a special event called
["Anatomy of a Scala Project"][friday-meetup]. See the 
[Event Outline](/2012/outline.html) page for details on the Friday event. This
event will also be in the Quorum.

# Details on Registration

Registration is $50 and covers Saturday and Sunday. Space is limited to 120
attendees. Please register on the [Scalathon 2012 Meetup page][meetup-page].

Friday's event, "Anatomy of a Scala Project" has a separate registration fee
and a separate [Meetup page][friday-meetup], since it might not appeal to every
Scalathon attendee. The cost to attend Friday's "Anatomy of a Scala Project"
event is $25 per participant.

# Training

In conjunction with Scalathon, two of our sponsors are also offering Scala
[training](/2012/training.html). Be sure to check into their offerings.
