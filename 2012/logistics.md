## Free accommodations

We are currently seeking volunteers from the Philadelphia developer
community willing to host out-of-town guests. Please visit the
[FAQ page](faq.html#host_guest) for information on volunteering.

We probably won't be able to provide free accommodations for more than a
handful of out-of-towners, so please don't rely on this option.
