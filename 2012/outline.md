# What's Scalathon?

Scalathon is an opportunity for the Scala community to come together and improve the Scala ecosystem over two jam packed days.

* **Scalathon is about code.**
* **Scalathon is social.**

## Scalathon may be for you if...

* You're looking to get involved in an exciting project.
* You'd like to improve your Scala by working with the best developers from around the world.
* You're looking for new collaborators on your existing project.
* You think Scala could be better documented.
* You want to promote your awesome library.

# Event outline

## Friday

On Friday, we'll be holding our special 
["Anatomy of a Scala Project"][friday-meetup] event.
This event is separate from the main Scalathon event. It's intended for those
who want to learn more about the tools, techniques, and best practices for
Scala open source projects.

The open source "mentors" for "Anatomy of a Scala Project" will be 
**Josh Suereth**, **Nathan Hamblen**, **Doug Tangren**, **Erik Osheim**,
**Brian Clapper**, and **Yuvi Masory**.
Each of the mentors has built and maintains various open source Scala
projects; several also maintain SBT plugins.

The discussion will include topics like:

* Setup: _giter8_, _git_, and other setup aids
* Building: getting started with _sbt_, using _Maven_ (shudder), etc.
* Testing: Using ScalaTest and Specs, SCCT for coverage, etc.
* Profiling: _Caliper_ and, maybe, _YourKit_
* Documentation: _Pamflet_, _Scaladoc_, _sbt-lwm_, Github Pages
* Releasing: _sbt-assembly_, publishing to Sonatype, announcing your project with _herald_, etc.
* Hosting: Where to put your code. (Should you use GitHub, like so many people? What about Bitbucket.org or other sites?)
* Anything else we think fits.

The session will include short presentations and hands-on demonstrations. Bring
your laptops!

The cost for "Anatomy of a Scala Project" is $25 per attendee.  You can sign
up at <http://www.meetup.com/scala-phase/events/62963952/>.


## Saturday

Saturday we'll be hacking all day. Saturday evening, 
[Novus Partners](http://www.novus.com/) will be sponsoring dinner and drinks.

Throughout the day there will be short talks, from representatives of various
[Scala projects](projects.html). These talks are all about welcoming newcomers
to the project.

Many of these talks will:

* highlight bite-sized bugs appropriate for new contributors
* give a crash course on the project's source code
* describe the project's build-modify-publish chain

We are hoping to provide breakfast and lunch, funding permitting.

## Sunday

Sunday we'll be hacking 9am-5pm. Throughout the day there will be
[enrichment talks](talks.html).

These won't be the kind of academic talks you would see at Scala Days or the
[Northeast Scala Symposium](http://nescala.org/). Instead, they will focus on
Scalathon's goal of helping Scala developers contribute to the language and its
libraries. Many Sunday talks will be tutorials on:

* advanced functional programming patterns
* Scala internals
* software best practices
* open source dynamics and community building
* essential software skills

# Our suggestion on the talks...

... is to not go to too many of them. Remember, Scalathon is all about 
hacking, something you can't do if you're stuck in a lecture hall all day. All
talks will be recorded and posted on Vimeo.com after the event. So our advice
is to go to a couple talks each day and save the rest for home.
