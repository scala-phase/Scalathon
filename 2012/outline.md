# What's Scalathon?

Scalathon is an opportunity for the Scala community to come together and improve the Scala ecosystem over two jam packed days.

* **Scalathon is about code.**
* **Scalathon is social.**

## Scalathon may be for you if...

* You're looking to get involved in an exciting project.
* You'd like to improve your Scala by working with the best developers from around the world.
* You're looking for new collaborators on your existing project.
* You think Scala could be better documented.
* You want to promote your awesome library.

# Event outline

## Saturday

Saturday we'll be hacking all day, 9am-10pm. Throughout the day there will be short talks in the auditorium by representatives of various [Scala projects](projects.html). These talks are all about welcoming newcomers to the project.

Many of these talks will:
* highlight bite-sized bugs appropriate for new contributors
* give a crash course on the project's source code
* describe the project's build-modify-distribute chain

We are hoping to provide breakfast and lunch, funding permitting.

## Sunday

Sunday we'll be hacking 9am-5pm. Throughout the day there will be [enrichment talks](talks.html). These won't be the kind of academic talks you would see at Scala Days or the Northeast Scala Symposium. Instead, they will focus on Scalathon's goal of helping Scala developers contribute to the language and its libraries. Many Sunday talks will be tutorials on:

* advanced functional programming patterns
* Scala internals
* software best practices
* open source dynamics and community building
* essential software skills 


## Friday

# Our suggestion on the talks...

... is to not go to too many of them. Remember, Scalathon is all about 
hacking, something you can't do if you're stuck in a lecture hall all day. All
talks will be recorded and posted on Vimeo.com after the event. So our advice
is to go to a couple talks each day and save the rest for home.
