Each registered project will be given a 20 minute timeslot on Saturday to give an introduction to developing the project. See the [FAQs](faq.html) to register your project.

All talks are optional and will be held in a separate area from the main
hackathon.

*We'll be updating this page as we go along.*

* **Joe Stein**, [Apache Kafka](http://incubator.apache.org/kafka/)
