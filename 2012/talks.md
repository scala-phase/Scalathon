* **Nikita Ivanov**: Live coding of streaming MapReduce, with comparisons
  to other approaches (Hadoop, Akka, etc.)
* **Alexander Podkhalyuzin**: *Scala Magic* (how everything compiles in Scala,
  issues with non-local return control, synchronization dangers with 
  `lazy val`, linearization and initialization order issues, binary 
  compatibility, and other goodies)
* **Seth Tisue**: *Lenses make updating nested immutable objects easier.*
  "Lenses aren't in the Scala standard library, but two libraries provide
  them: Scalaz and Miles Sabin's Shapeless.  I'll show how you to use the
  Shapeless version, and we'll look at how it's implemented.  Let's make
  this interactive; bring your laptop and code along. (About 30 minutes)"
