In association with Scalathon, two sponsors are providing Scala training.

## Fast Track to Scala, by Chariot Solutions

This two-day course, designed by Martin Odersky, the creator of the Scala
programming language, and Heiko Seeberger, a recognized Scala expert, will give
you an excellent grounding in Scala.  It is intended to enable developers or
development managers, who are experienced programmers in Java or other
production languages like C++, C# or Ruby, to confidently start programming in
Scala. No previous knowledge of Scala is assumed. Although intense, the course
ensures you will have a solid understanding of the fundamentals of the
language, the tooling and the development process as well as a good
appreciation of the more advanced features. If you already have Scala
programming experience, then this course could be a useful refresher.
