# We Have Videos

The Scalathon [talks](talks.html) were videotaped. All videos are
available on the [PHASE Vimeo page](http://vimeo.com/scalaphase/). However,
since there are *other* videos on the PHASE Vimeo page, the Scalathon videos
are also grouped in a [Scalathon-specific Vimeo Channel](http://vimeo.com/channels/scalathon2011). (The **Video** links, below, all
link out to Vimeo.)

Where the presenter provided slides, we have included those here, as well.

Check back frequently for updates.
