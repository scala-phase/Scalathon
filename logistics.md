# Getting to Philadelphia

## By plane

[Philadelphia International Airport (PHL)](http://www.phl.org/) is the
closest major airport.

## By train

Take [Amtrak](http://www.amtrak.com/) to 30th Street Station
(PHL), which is just a few blocks from the event location.

## By car

Penn's admissions office has [driving directions][] that take you right to
the center of campus.

# Where to Stay

## Hotels

The closest hotels to the event are the [Sheraton][] and [The Inn at Penn][]. But they are rather pricey. For good deals see [Club Quarters][] and [Crowne Plaza Downtown][] which are a short subway ride away.
The University of Pennsylvania has hotel suggestions
[here](http://www.admissionsug.upenn.edu/visiting/accommodations.php) and
[here](http://www.upenn.edu/campus/philadelphia.php/). Any hotel in center city provides easy access to campus.

Once you have selected your hotel, post [where you are staying][].

## Free accommodations

We are currently seeking volunteers from the Philadelphia developer
community willing to host out-of-town guests. Please visit the
[FAQ page](faq.html#host_guest) for information on volunteering.

We probably won't be able to provide free accommodations for more than a
handful of out-of-towners, so please don't rely on this option.

# Getting to Penn's campus

## From the airport

* There is a [SEPTA][] Airport Express Train (R1) every half hour; the fare is
  $7 (pay after you get on the train). If coming directly to the hackathon,
  get off at University City station and walk a block west and a block
  north; otherwise, go one stop further to 30th Street Station to connect
  to other forms of transportation.
* A cab from the airport to Center City or University City is about $30.
* Although probably a waste of money if you're only coming to the
  hackathon, the PHL website has a list of
  [rental car companies](http://www.phl.org/rental_cars.html). Penn's
  admissions office has [driving directions][] that take you right into the
  center of campus.
* Walking is probably not an option.

## Without a car

* [SEPTA][] operates the trains, buses, and trolleys in Philadelphia. The
  fare is $2 per trip, exact change (so save up your $1s before you come).
  You can also get tokens (which are cheaper, and don't require exact
  change to buy) at most big stops. Their site is a little bit unfriendly;
  we recommend using the
  [Trip Planner](http://airs1.septa.org/bin/query.exe/en) to find out what
  routes to take, then consult the
  [route schedules](http://www.septa.org/service.html) to find out how
  often those lines run, so you know how flexible your trip will be.
* There are about a dozen cab companies serving various parts of the city;
  Google will point the way. You will likely be within Center City and
  University City (sometimes called West Philadelphia) for the duration of
  your visit. Hailing cabs is generally easy at 34th and Walnut, just
  outside the hackathon venue.
* Walking is always an option. Philadelphia is a very walkable city.

## With a car

There is some metered parking on-campus (especially on 38th street), for
$1/hour. To help with interpreting the maps, Levine Hall is located
at 34th and Walnut.

* [Parking on campus](http://www.admissionsug.upenn.edu/visiting/directions.php)
* [The Penn Parking site](http://cms.business-services.upenn.edu/parking/)
* [Parking map](http://www.business-services.upenn.edu/parking/map.html)

The [Google map](#google_map) also highlights the public parking locations
near the hackathon; the fee is about $13/day.

While you're planning your route, keep in mind that while the city is laid
out mostly in a grid, about half of the roads are one-way.
