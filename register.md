# Friday #

## Documentation spree ##
[Friday's PL Club meeting and documentation spree](outline.html#friday) are much smaller, limited to 30
participants. You must register for a
[separate Meetup.com event](http://www.meetup.com/scala-phase/events/17274762/)
to attend. Your registration fee goes directly to a catered lunch.

## Crash course ##
The Scala crash course for women and friends is limited to 20 students. You must register for a [separate Meetup.com event](http://www.meetup.com/scala-phase/events/17397558/) to attend.

**All Friday events are optional and separate from the main hackathon. It's
fine if you can't make it.**

# Free registration offer #
The University of Pensylvania Department of Computer and Information Science has agreed to pay the registration fees of the next 10 women who sign up.

Please [join PHASE](http://www.meetup.com/scala-phase/) and then email contact@scalathon.org to complete registration. Please state if you would also like to go to the [crash course](http://www.meetup.com/scala-phase/events/17397558/) or [documentation spree](http://www.meetup.com/scala-phase/events/17274762/).

# A friendly suggestion #

The [Northeast Scala Symposium](http://www.nescala.org/2011/) easily sold
out at 100 attendees, leaving dozens on the waiting list. Don't delay your
registration, especially if you want a spot at the documentation spree.
